Emotion-Based Quote Generator

The Emotion-Based Quote Generator is a creative React web app that connects emotions with words of inspiration.
Users can choose an emotion — such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Calm, or Love — and instantly see a motivational quote paired with a visually matching background image.
It is a simple yet meaningful project that blends React, creativity, and mood-driven design into one interactive experience.
